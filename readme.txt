== Description ==

WordPress doesn't have a good way to generate pages or categories lists, this plug-in is inspirited by the one from Adi Sieker, that was a very good base to start.
It uses an array because it can provide better tag options than a simple string launch, but every option has a default value, so if the default one is the one desired can be omitted in the initialization.
If you have your custom css with this plug-in you can create also interactive menu or very useful site maps, see screenshots.
